- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
I can see that Encapsulation means you need to think further ahead about how elements of your program will interact with each other. I think I'm still a little unsure about when to make things private or public. Why can't you just make most elements public so they're easier to access? Does doing that require more memory?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I felt fairly comfortable with carrying out the steps of this assignment. The places I fumbled were in not knowing the details of how ArrayLists work, but I was able to work those issues out by looking at documentation and going to TA hours. I would recommend that someone in the future start this assignment early so that there's time to get comfortable with how ArrayLists work.
